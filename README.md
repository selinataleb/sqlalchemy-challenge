This project is about doing a climate analysis about the Hawai area. 
we have 2 files in this project, Surfsup and app.py. 

The first part analyzes and explores the climate data. 
We used SQLAlchemy to connect SQLDatabase and an automap function to reflect tables into classes. 
We started by finding the most recent date in the dataset which is "2017-08-23". Moving on, we designed a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data and plotted the results using Pandas and Matplotlib.
